Levels 4 and 5 were reached easily by AGI, and that was the start of the wealth age. AI solved global warming . A little after it discovered a new way to move in space, called “Space Jump” that was faster than the speed of light. The funny thing is that it took all physics experts THREE MONTHS to understand how this tech worked. \n For the first time in history, humanity can move from earth to a better place. After discovering the Space Jump method, we sent millions of spacecraft engineered by ASI to map our galaxy. After a few months (!) we had a lot of better alternatives to earth. We finally choose a star, and call it Orion. And anything else is history."
